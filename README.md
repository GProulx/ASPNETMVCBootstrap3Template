ASPNETMVCBootstrap3Template
===========================

This is the default Visual Studio ASP.NET MVC project before (first commit) before and after migrating to Bootstrap 3.0.

It's another way to present my [blog post about how to upgrade an MVC project to Bootstrap 3.0](http://www.ghislainproulx.net/Blog/2013/09/using-bootstrap-3-with-visual-studio-2013-aspnet-mvc-template)

Hope that help !
